# Fear of God

This project showcases a visually stunning mobile application UI/UX design, originally created by <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6938770-Fear-Of-God-Fashion-Store-App-Concept" target="_blank" >Lisa Parker on Dribbble</a>. The design incorporates dynamic elements like Hero animations and a combination of vertical and horizontal list views. Built using Flutter, this demo leverages its powerful UI, typography, and animation capabilities to bring an engaging and seamless user experience to life.
