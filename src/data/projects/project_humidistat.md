# IoT Humidity Slider

This demo project is inspired by an original design from <a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6315218-IoT-Humidity-App-Slider">Elijah Bozniak on Dribbble</a>. It showcases a mobile application for controlling home humidity, featuring sleek user interface and fluid animations.  

I selected this design to highlight UI animations and interactions within React Native using the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/">Reanimated</a> library. Reanimated is a robust animation library that enables developers to create intricate, interactive, and high-performance animations directly on the UI thread.
