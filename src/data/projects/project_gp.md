# Genetic Programming Solver

This project explored a specific subset of heuristic algorithms known as Genetic Algorithms, which are inspired by the process of natural selection. Genetic Programming, a related technique, evolves computer programs or mathematical expressions by iteratively selecting, mutating, and recombining solutions to optimize performance based on a set of defined fitness functions.

My goal was to apply these techniques to solve problems with a tree-structured nature, such as circuits, mathematical expressions, and decision trees. This solver takes an input-output mapping and generates a function—either discrete or continuous—that best fits the given data, effectively acting as a curve-fitting algorithm optimized for hierarchical expressions.  

For my **Digital Circuits** course project, I utilized this solution to generate custom circuit components, significantly enhancing my design process. This project was recognized as the best in the class.
