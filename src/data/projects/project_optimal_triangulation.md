# Optimal Triangulation 

This project was developed for my Advanced Algorithms course, where my team and I designed and implemented an algorithm to triangulate a convex polygon in a way that minimizes the total length of internal edges (i.e., the sum of triangle perimeters). We achieved this optimization using a dynamic programming approach.

Beyond algorithm design and implementation, I also developed a GUI desktop application to visually demonstrate our optimizer in action, allowing for an interactive and live presentation in class.
