This repository contains the source code for my statically generated website that is hosted on [`gh-pages`](https://pages.github.com/). 


# Patches: 

`gh-pages` version `6.3.0` has a issue when deploying the website on Windows. For this verison, manually applying [this patch](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages/issues/585#issuecomment-2585457896) fixed the issue.
