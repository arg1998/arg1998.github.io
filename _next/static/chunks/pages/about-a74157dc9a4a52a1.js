My name is Amir, but I am colloquially known as **ARGOSTA** in other parallel universes. My profession is writing code and bending computers to my will (though sometimes they bend me, to which I respond by grabbing my giant debugger and declaring war). But aside from programming and ill-timed humor, I enjoy MANY things. I like dipping my toe into other domains of science and learning things outside of my knowledge base — specifically, physics, cosmology, and biology. Binge-watching science communicators on YouTube is my hobby!\r\n\r\nI love getting into hands-on mode and building things. Anything for which I have the tools and resources becomes a potential project (I mean, jet engines are pretty tough to build, but I'd definitely try if I had the money and time). From wooden model houses to actual multi-story treehouses, from small circuits to full-blown electrical projects (YES, I have been electrocuted multiple times, and NO, I have not learned my lesson). My face lights up whenever I'm tasked with repairing something because I love reverse engineering and figuring out how others build things. It's not just about dismantling physical objects and rebuilding them; it's a mindset. I enjoy figuring out how any system works and trying to find loopholes, bugs, and hidden gems within it. I'm not claiming to be a reverse-engineering expert (yet), but I do have a keen eye for misplaced blocks. So yeah, building and breaking stuff is my thing...\r\n\r\nOften, I contemplate how everything connects — from subatomic particles to the unimaginable scales of the universe — and how our sentient mind, while observing this grand reality show, still asks: _\"Who ate my leftover pizza in the fridge?\"_ It's absurd, right? Also nice to know that I frequently overdose with absurdism. Another not-so-fun activity of mine is playing with the sense of selfhood and identity at the edge of meaning by exploring altered states of consciousness. And like other self-proclaimed enlightened people out there, I also enjoy living in [a hut in the woods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK2SMIOHYig)!\r\n\r\nI also enjoy writing poems and short stories. They mostly explore internal struggles, such as identity and existential crises. Some are about the nature of humans and our quest to extract meaning from paradoxical perceptions. Music is my air, water, and food. I CANNOT live without it. Actually, most of my writing is inspired by [Platon Karataev](https://g.co/kgs/KsSfCvH) and [Camel](https://g.co/kgs/TvWQMh3).\r\n\r\nI love hiking, camping, and going on adventures in the woods. Walking in the woods is meditation for me. I am also a certified tree hugger — I love those green beasts! As far as sports go, I practiced Taekwondo for 7 years, Parkour (free running) for about 2 years, and soccer for 5 years until some pesky injuries prevented me from continuing them.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot more to say, but I guess this should be enough for you, the noble reader, to get a glimpse of who I am. If you'd like to chat with me, send me an email.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nby **ARGOSTA**\r\n\r\n</span>"})})})}},e=>{var n=n=>e(e.s=n);e.O(0,[611,111,617,504,636,593,792],()=>n(99482)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
